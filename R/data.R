#' Ribosome accumulation-study: Protein data.
#'
#' Relative protein abundance data measured using immuno-blotting. Protein was
#' extracted from muscle tissue samples following RNA extraction using a standard
#' Trizol protocol (see Details).
#'
#' All samples from each participant were analyzed on one gel/blot, with replicates
#' per participants analyzed in new experiments. The total protein stain (Pierceâ„¢
#' Reversible Protein Stain Kit for PVDF Membranes) was used to normalize signals
#' from specific protein targets. Signals were detected using chemiluminescence
#' after bindning of specific antibodies to the membrane and subsequent binding
#' of secondary HRP-conjugated antibody.
#'
#' Total-protein and target-specific signals are normalized to maximum signals per
#' gel as exposure times, antibody affinity etc. differs between experiments.
#' These signals are "uncalibrated" between gels but can be used to investigate
#' changes across time/condition within participants and differences in change
#' across participants/groups under the assumption that signal intensity and protein
#' abundance is linear across gels.
#'
#' A set of calibration samples are available for t-s6 and t-UBF. One sample per
#' participant was measured on a calibration gel to allow for comparisons in
#' relative signals across participants. The `cal` variable includes the relative
#' signal of the calibration sample per participant. The `cal_sample` indicates which
#' sample to use for calibration.

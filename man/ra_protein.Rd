\description{
Relative protein abundance data measured using immuno-blotting. Protein was
extracted from muscle tissue samples following RNA extraction using a standard
Trizol protocol (see Details).
}
\details{
All samples from each participant were analyzed on one gel/blot, with replicates
per participants analyzed in new experiments. The total protein stain (Pierceâ„¢
Reversible Protein Stain Kit for PVDF Membranes) was used to normalize signals
from specific protein targets. Signals were detected using chemiluminescence
after bindning of specific antibodies to the membrane and subsequent binding
of secondary HRP-conjugated antibody.

Total-protein and target-specific signals are normalized to maximum signals per
gel as exposure times, antibody affinity etc. differs between experiments.
These signals are "uncalibrated" between gels but can be used to investigate
changes across time/condition within participants and differences in change
across participants/groups under the assumption that signal intensity and protein
abundance is linear across gels.

A set of calibration samples are available for t-s6 and t-UBF. One sample per
participant was measured on a calibration gel to allow for comparisons in
relative signals across participants. The \code{cal} variable includes the relative
signal of the calibration sample per participant. The \code{cal_sample} indicates which
sample to use for calibration.
